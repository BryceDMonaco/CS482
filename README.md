# CS 482 - Artificial Intelligence
This is a repository for all of my homework and project code for CS 482.

### Project 1: Tic Tac Toe
This project consists of using a provided API to create a program which can win or tie any game of tic tac toe.

### Project 2: Spam Filter
This project consists of two programs. The first, Training.cpp takes in a set of training data, classifies words as spam or ham, and then sends that classification to another program (Classify) which will scan through a different set of data and classify messages in that different data as spam or ham based on the classification of the first program.
